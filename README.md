**JobFinder** is a sophisticated Python application designed to streamline the creation of tailored CVs and the dispatch of personalized emails to potential employers. Utilizing the Gmail API for email delivery, JobFinder allows users to configure their application via a `curriculum.json` file, ensuring a highly customizable and efficient job application process.
## Features

- **Customized CV Generation**: Automatically create CV PDFs from a JSON template tailored for different job applications.
- **Personalized Email Dispatch**: Send customized emails to potential employers with configurable intervals and dynamic content.
- **Email Logging**: Maintain a log of sent emails in a specified sub-folder with timestamped filenames.
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Use placeholders in emails to personalize each message for specific companies.
- **Modular Template System**: Easily create and use custom templates for CV generation by defining a `generate_pdf_from_json` function.

## Usage

### Configuration

1. **`curriculum.json`**: This file contains the necessary information to generate your CV and send emails. Below is a sample schema:

    ```json
    {
        "minimumInterval": 30,
        "maximumInterval": 45,
        "message": {
            "opening": [
                "<p>Greetings {company} Team,</p>"
            ],
            "constant": [
                "<p>Noticed you have a vacancy for {position}.<br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> I am available to work after 17pm[UTC] and before 9am[UTC] exclusively at the moment.</p>"
            ],
            "variable": [
                "<p>I believe my skills and experiences align well with {company}â€™s needs, and I am eager to contribute to your team.</p>"
            ],
            "ending": [
                "<p>I left my CV in attachment for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.</p>",
                "<p>Best regards,<br>{name}</p>"
            ]
        },
        "companies": [
            {
                "logo": "GitHub.png",
                "email": "example@example.com",
                "position": "Software Architect"
            }
        ],
        "avatar": "avatar.jpg",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "title": "Your Title",
        "about": [
            "Brief description about yourself."
        ],
        "contact": {
            "address": "Your Address",
            "phone": "Your Phone Number",
            "email": "your.email@example.com",
            "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
            "github": "https://github.com/yourprofile"
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Avatar Image**:
    - The avatar image can be named anything and placed in any directory, as long as the correct path is specified in `curriculum.json`.
    - **Supported Formats**: When using the Image class in ReportLab's `reportlab.platypus` module, the following image formats are supported:
        - **JPEG/JPG**: Ideal for photographic images.
        - **PNG**: Supports transparency and is lossless.
        - **GIF**: Primarily for simple graphics and animations.
        - **BMP**: Generally uncompressed.
        - **TIFF/TIF**: Often used for high-quality images.
        - **PICT**: Macintosh Picture format, though less common.

3. **Company Information**:
    - **Logo**: The company logo is mandatory. The filename of the logo image is crucial because it is used to parse the company's name from the file name. For example, a file named `Accenture.png` will be associated with the company name "Accenture".
    - **Email**: The email address is required as it serves as the target recipient for the application email. 
    - **Position**: The position you're applying for is mandatory. It is used both in the body of the email and in the email subject line to tailor the message to the specific job opening.

### Template Customization

1. **Create a Custom Template:** Define a `generate_pdf_from_json` function in your custom template.
2. **Update the Import:** Change the import statement in `GenerateCV.py` to use your custom template:
```python
import templates.base as template  # Original import
import templates.my_custom as template  # Custom template import
```
3. **Sample customized GenerateCV:**
```python
import os
import json
import templates.my_custom as template

def generate_cv_for_companies(data='curriculum.json', pdf_folder='output'):
    if data == 'curriculum.json':
        with open(data, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            data = json.load(file)

    image_extensions = ('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp', '.tiff', '.tif', '.pict')

    companies = data.get('companies', '')
    if companies:
        for company in companies:
            company_logo = company['logo']
            company_logo_path = f"logos/{company_logo}"
            company_name, ext = os.path.splitext(company_logo)
            if os.path.exists(company_logo_path) and ext.lower() in image_extensions:
                output_path = os.path.join(pdf_folder, f"curriculum_{company_name}.pdf")
                template.generate_pdf_from_json(output_path, data, company_logo_path)

    template.generate_pdf_from_json('output/curriculum.pdf', data)
```

### CV Generation Process

- **Multiple Versions**: Each time the CV Generator runs, it will create both a customized CV for each company listed in `curriculum.json` and a default CV without a custom watermark. Existing files are not overwritten; instead, a GUID is suffixed to the filename, allowing multiple versions of your CV to coexist.
- **File Naming**: Generated CVs will have filenames in the format `curriculum_companyName_GUID.pdf`.

### Email Sending Process

- **Latest Files**: When sending emails, the code will select the latest files generated for each company.
- **Email Attachments**: Despite the filename being `curriculum_companyName_GUID.pdf`, the attachment will be sent as `curriculum_companyName.pdf` in the email for professionalism.
