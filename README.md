## Usage

### Configuration

1. **`curriculum.json`**: This file contains the necessary information to generate your CV and send emails. Below is a sample schema:

    ```json
    {
        "minimumInterval": 30,
        "maximumInterval": 45,
        "message": {
            "opening": [
                "<p>Greetings {company} Team,</p>"
            ],
            "constant": [
                "<p>Noticed you have a vacancy for {position}.<br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> I am available to work after 17pm[UTC] and before 9am[UTC] exclusively at the moment.</p>"
            ],
            "variable": [
                "<p>I believe my skills and experiences align well with {company}â€™s needs, and I am eager to contribute to your team.</p>"
            ],
            "ending": [
                "<p>I left my CV in attachment for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.</p>",

**Pro Tip**: *Guiding yourself with the sampled `curriculum.json` will facilitate.*

## Template Customization

1. **Create a Custom Template:** Define a `generate_pdf_from_json` function in your custom template.
2. **Update the Import:** Change the import statement in `GenerateCV.py` to use your custom template:
    ```python
    import templates.Base as template  # Original import
    import templates.MyCustom as template  # Custom template import
    ```
3. **Run `MakeExecutable.ps1`:** It will automatically recompile your python scripts and remake `JobFinder.exe`.

### CV Generation Process

- **Multiple Versions**: Every time the CV Generator runs, it creates both a tailored CV for each company listed in curriculum.json and a default CV without a custom watermark. Files are saved with a GUID suffix to prevent overwriting existing files, allowing multiple versions to coexist.
- **Multiple Versions**: Each time the CV Generator runs, it will create both a customized CV for each company listed in `curriculum.json` and a default CV without a custom watermark. Existing files are not overwritten; instead, a GUID is suffixed to the filename, allowing multiple versions of your CV to coexist.
- **File Naming**: Generated CVs will have filenames in the format `curriculum_companyName_GUID.pdf`.

### Email Sending Process

- **Latest Files**: When sending emails, the code will select the latest files generated for each company.
- **Email Attachments**: When sending emails, the most recent CV files are used. Although the filenames may include a GUID (e.g., `curriculum_companyName_GUID.pdf`), the attachment in the email is named without the GUID (e.g., `curriculum_companyName.pdf`).

### Setup Google Cloud Console for Gmail API

1. **Create a New Project**:
    - Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project.

2. **Enable Gmail API**:
    - Go to the "API & Services" dashboard.
    - Click on "Enable APIs and Services" and search for "Gmail API".
    - Enable the Gmail API for your project.

3. **Create Credentials**:
    - Go to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials".
    - Select "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" and configure the consent screen.
  
4. **Set the OAuth Scope**:
    - When configuring OAuth consent, ensure that the scope `/auth/gmail.modify` is included. This scope allows the application to read and modify Gmail messages and labels, which is necessary for sending and managing emails.

5. **Download and Place `credentials.json`**:
    - Download the `credentials.json` file from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Place the `credentials.json` file in the same directory as the executable (e.g., `JobFinder.exe`). This ensures the application can access the necessary credentials for authentication with the Gmail API.

### Running the Application

- **Execute JobFinder**:
    - Run the application by executing `JobFinder.exe`.
    - Choose the desired option:
        - [1] **Generate CVs**
        - [2] **Generate emails**
        - [3] **Generate both CVs and emails in sequence**
