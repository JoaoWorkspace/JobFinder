# JobFinder

**JobFinder** is a Python application designed to streamline the process of generating tailored CVs and sending personalized emails to potential employers. It utilizes the Gmail API for sending emails and allows users to configure their application using a `curriculum.json` file.

## Features

- **Customized CV Generation**: Create CV PDFs from a JSON template tailored for different job applications.
- **Personalized Email Sending**: Send emails to companies with customizable intervals and dynamic content.
- **Email Logging**: Log sent emails in a specified sub-folder with timestamped filenames.
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Use placeholders in emails for company-specific details to personalize each message.

## Usage

### Configuration

1. **`curriculum.json`**: This file contains the necessary information to generate your CV and send emails. Below is a sample schema:

    ```json
    {
        "minimumInterval": 30,
        "maximumInterval": 45,
        "message": {
            "opening": [
                "<p>Greetings {company} Team,</p>"
            ],
            "constant": [
                "<p>Noticed you have a vacancy for {position}.<br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> I am available to work after 17pm[UTC] and before 9am[UTC] exclusively at the moment.</p>"
            ],
            "variable": [
                "<p>I believe my skills and experiences align well with {company}â€™s needs, and I am eager to contribute to your team.</p>"
            ],
            "ending": [
                "<p>I left my CV in attachment for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.</p>",
                "<p>Best regards,<br>{name}</p>"
            ]
        },
        "companies": [
            {
                "logo": "Accenture.png",
                "email": "example@example.com",
                "position": "Software Engineer"
            }
        ],
        "avatar": "avatar.jpg",
        "name": "Your Name",
        "title": "Your Title",
        "about": [
            "Brief description about yourself."
        ],
        "contact": {
            "address": "Your Address",
            "phone": "Your Phone Number",
            "email": "your.email@example.com",
            "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
            "github": "https://github.com/yourprofile"
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Avatar Image**:
    - Place an image named `avatar.jpg`, `avatar.jpeg`, or `avatar.png` in the same directory as `curriculum.json`.
    - This image will be included in the generated CV. Ensure that the file name matches exactly with the name specified in the `curriculum.json`.

3. **Company Information**:
    - **Logo**: The company logo is mandatory. The filename of the logo image is crucial because it is used to parse the company's name from the file name. For example, a file named `Accenture.png` will be associated with the company name "Accenture".
    - **Email**: The email address is required as it serves as the target recipient for the application email. 
    - **Position**: The position you're applying for is mandatory. It is used both in the body of the email and in the email subject line to tailor the message to the specific job opening.

### CV Generation Process

Every time the CV Generator runs, it will create both:
- A **customized CV for each company** listed in `curriculum.json`, which includes a custom watermark.
- A **default CV without a custom watermark** to be used as a general-purpose resume.
